# YOleotard Checkout Known Issues

Codex must read this file before making any code change.

This file tracks known risks, limitations, and unresolved technical debt.

## Active Issues

### Main PHP file is very large

Status: known technical debt.

Details:

- `yoleotard-checkout-invoice.php` contains most backend behavior: settings, AJAX, REST webhooks, KeyCRM, shipping, payment finalization, invoice generation, emails, and sold-item hiding.
- This makes changes harder to review and increases the risk of accidental regressions.

Handling:

- Do not rewrite the full file at once.
- New backend features should be added as separate classes, preferably under `includes/`.
- Existing logic should be extracted gradually when a task touches that area.

### PHP CLI availability was restored

Status: resolved environment note.

Details:

- A previous `php -l yoleotard-checkout-invoice.php` check failed because `php` was not available in PATH.
- On 2026-05-31, PHP was found at `D:\Projects\php-8.5.6-nts-Win32-vs17-x64\php.exe`.
- `php -l yoleotard-checkout-invoice.php` passed with no syntax errors.

Handling:

- Try `php -l` after each PHP change.
- If PHP becomes unavailable again, record the failed check in `DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.

### GitHub CLI is unavailable locally

Status: environment limitation.

Details:

- `gh` was not recognized in the current PowerShell environment.

Handling:

- Use normal `git commit` and `git push` for rollback points when credentials are available.
- Install GitHub CLI only if PR creation, GitHub auth inspection, or GitHub issue/PR workflows are needed.

### Sold-item auto-hide previously logged local IDs and backed up too much meta

Status: fixed in current code, monitor after next live Monobank purchase.

Details:

- Older admin logs used local WordPress checkout post IDs like `local order #21953`, which looked arbitrary compared with the intended KeyCRM order number.
- Auto-hide backed up the full page meta array before every first order-specific hide, including previous `_yo_checkout_autohide_backup_*` entries. On a YOOtheme page with repeated purchases this could recursively grow backup meta and increase timeout/memory risk before the final hide-result log was written.

Handling:

- Sold-item hiding now lives in `includes/class-yo-checkout-sold-items.php`.
- Logs now prefer KeyCRM `order_id`, formatted as `Order #KEYCRM (local #ID)`.
- Backup now excludes previous auto-hide backup meta.
- Watch the next real successful card purchase for a final log line such as `Updated post_content.`, `Updated meta: ...`, or `YOOtheme Builder JSON grid item was not found...`.

## Watch Areas

- Payment finalization must remain idempotent. Repeated webhooks or polling must not create duplicate KeyCRM payments, emails, or status updates.
- Checkout totals must remain consistent across frontend cart, backend order meta, KeyCRM payloads, bank invoices, card fees, shipping, and emails.
- YOOtheme sold-item hiding must stay precise and avoid hiding whole product grids or unrelated content.
- Guest checkout AJAX endpoints must keep nonce and buyer/session handling intact.
